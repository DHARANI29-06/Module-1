# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators -Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To write a Python program for print two complex numbers, and get the user input using the `float()` function.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Use the `float()` function to get two complex numbers as input from the user.
3. Print the complex numbers entered by the user.
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```
a=float(input())
b=float(input())
c=complex(a,b)
print(c)
print(a)
print(b)
```
