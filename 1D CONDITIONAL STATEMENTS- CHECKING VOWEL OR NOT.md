## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- that number is equal to 0 or positive number or negative.

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to check whether the given number is 0 or positive or negative using if..else statement
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Take a number input from the user
3. Check if the number is less than the zero or positive or negative
4. if it is 0 display "Number is 0"
5. if it is positive number display "get the input from the user is a positive number"
6. Otherwise, display "get the input from the user is a Negative number"
7. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```
a=int(input())
if a==0:
    print("Number is 0")
elif a>=0:
    print(f"{a} is a Positive number")
elif a<=0:
    print(f"{a} is a Negative number")
else:
    print(" ")
```
